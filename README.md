# CodeClauseInternship_Blindness_Detection

Creating a blindness detection model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves several steps. This model can be designed to detect eye diseases or conditions that may lead to blindness. Here are the steps involved:

Problem Definition:

Clearly define the problem you want to solve. Are you detecting specific eye diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma, or are you detecting general eye conditions that may lead to blindness?
Data Collection:

Gather a large and diverse dataset of eye images. The dataset should include images of both healthy eyes and eyes with various conditions related to blindness. You may need to collaborate with medical institutions or use publicly available datasets.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset. Common preprocessing steps include resizing images to a consistent size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset with techniques like rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments to increase model robustness.
Data Splitting:

Divide the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and test sets. A typical split might be 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
Model Architecture:

Design the architecture of your CNN model. CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks. You can start with a standard architecture like VGG, ResNet, or create a custom architecture.
Model Training:

Train the CNN model on the training dataset using appropriate loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification) and optimization algorithms. Monitor the model's performance on the validation set to prevent overfitting.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Experiment with different hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and network architecture to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics:

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset to get an unbiased estimate of its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
